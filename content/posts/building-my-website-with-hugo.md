# What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/) is a fast [static site generator](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/static-vs-dynamic-website) written in Go, and designed to make website creation easy and bearable.

It's a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your websiteâ€™s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages to name a few. The sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP, which is awesome because I despise doing any of those things.

As of right now Hugo is the ideal website creation tool as it boasts nearly instant runtime and the ability to rebuild as soon as a change is made.

# How I got started

Lucky for you Hugo has great documentation and a walkthrough guide to get you setup with a basic website that can easily be fleshed out from a solid start point. 

I also found it useful to use some external resources, which I've listed down below that other people have created which tailor to what I wanted to get out of my website
