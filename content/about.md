Im a soon to be graduate majoring in computer science with a passion for all things cyber. I needed a place to keep everything in a collected space so clearly the only thing to do was put it all on a website

I currently work as a consultant for [ZX Security](https://zxsecurity.co.nz) doing all sorts of cool things.
