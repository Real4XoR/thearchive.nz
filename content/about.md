## Who am I?

I'm a soon to be graduate majoring in computer science with a passion for all things cyber. I needed a place to keep everything in a collected place so clearly the only thing to do was put it all on a website.

## What I do

I currently work as an intern for [ZX Security](https://zxsecurity.co.nz) doing all sorts of cool things.
