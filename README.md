# The Archive

Is a portfolio website linked [here](https://thearchive.nz). that is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),running through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I'll try my best to keep it up to date with projects and blog posts as they oppurtunities arise.
